# 01-PROBLEM-DISCOVERY DIRECTORY PLAN

## PURPOSE
Document how we discovered and characterized the initial AI system failures without revealing domain-specific IP.

## TARGET AUDIENCE VALUE PROPOSITION
- **R&D Engineer – Generative AI**: Shows systematic approach to identifying AI failure patterns in production
- **AI/ML Engineer**: Demonstrates real-world AI debugging methodology under user impact pressure
- **Lead Software Engineer**: Shows methodical problem discovery and stakeholder communication

## DIRECTORY CONTENTS PLANNED

### 1. failure-patterns.md
**What it contains:**
- Classification of different types of AI failures observed
- Pattern recognition methodology for production AI systems
- Timeline of failure discovery and escalation

**Source files from our project:**
- `downloaded-logs-20250902-161443.json` - for anonymized failure examples
- Our conversation history - for failure categorization we developed
- `backend/mcp-service/recentQuiz.txt` - for production failure patterns

**Anonymization strategy:**
- Remove educational domain specifics ("Grade 12 Mathematics" → "Domain-specific mathematical content")
- Remove business context ("StuddiBuddi" → "AI-powered educational platform")
- Focus on technical failure types: parsing errors, API integration failures, model output inconsistencies

### 2. log-analysis-methodology.md
**What it contains:**
- Step-by-step approach to analyzing production logs for AI systems
- How to identify signal vs noise in complex multi-component systems
- Tools and techniques for pattern recognition in log data

**Source files from our project:**
- Our conversation where we analyzed the logs systematically
- Examples from `downloaded-logs-20250902-161443.json` (anonymized)
- The process we used to identify Q3.1, Q4.1, etc. failures

**Key technical insights to highlight:**
- Multi-layer log analysis (application logs, container logs, API response logs)
- Correlation techniques between user reports and technical failures
- Statistical analysis of failure rates by component

### 3. sample-failure-logs.json
**What it contains:**
- Carefully anonymized examples of the actual failure logs we analyzed
- Structured to show different failure types without revealing domain specifics
- JSON format to demonstrate real production log structure

**Source files from our project:**
- Selective excerpts from `downloaded-logs-20250902-161443.json`
- Examples of the specific failures we tracked (Q3.1, Q9.1, Q11.1, Q14.2, etc.)

**Anonymization process:**
- Replace educational content with generic mathematical expressions
- Replace user IDs with anonymized tokens
- Keep technical error patterns intact
- Maintain timestamp relationships for failure correlation analysis

## VALUE DEMONSTRATION
This directory shows:
1. **Production AI Experience**: Real failures with real user impact
2. **Systematic Investigation**: Not ad-hoc debugging but methodical analysis
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Ability to see forest through trees in complex systems
4. **Communication Skills**: Can explain technical problems to stakeholders

## TECHNICAL DEPTH LEVEL
- **Beginner-friendly**: Clear methodology explanation
- **Expert-validating**: Sufficient technical detail to show competence
- **Interview-ready**: Contains talking points for technical discussions

## STORY ARC FOR THIS DIRECTORY
"Users started reporting incorrect answers from our AI system. Instead of random debugging, I systematically analyzed production logs to identify patterns, categorize failure types, and build a foundation for targeted investigation. This methodical approach revealed that what initially looked like random AI failures were actually multiple distinct technical issues requiring different solutions."

## FILES NEEDED FROM CURRENT PROJECT
1. `downloaded-logs-20250902-161443.json` - source material for anonymized examples
2. `backend/mcp-service/recentQuiz.txt` - additional failure patterns
3. Our conversation history - methodology we developed
4. The specific failure cases we identified and categorized

## ANONYMIZATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Remove all business-specific references
- [ ] Replace educational content with generic examples
- [ ] Keep technical error patterns intact
- [ ] Maintain complexity level to show real production challenges
- [ ] Focus on methodology over domain specifics

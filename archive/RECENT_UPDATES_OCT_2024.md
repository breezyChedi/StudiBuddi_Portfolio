## ðŸ”„ Updated Existing Sections

### **03-root-cause-analysis/** - Enhanced with Recent Debugging Work

**New Addition: Wolfram API Integration Debugging**

**Problem:** Multi-AI pipeline (Gemini â†’ Wolfram Eval â†’ Groq) generating incorrect MCQ options
- Gemini generated probability question with Wolfram code: `N[1 - Binomial[10,3]/Binomial[15,3]]`
- All 4 MCQ options were wrong (should be 67/91, got 1001/1365, 364/1365, etc.)
- Wolfram skipped evaluation claiming "text-only options"

**Root Cause Found:**
```python
# Bug in wolfram_service.py line 980
clean_text = re.sub(r'\$[^$]*\$', '', option_text)  # Remove $...$
# Then check for digits...

# For "$\frac{1001}{1365}$":
# After removing $...$ â†’ empty string â†’ no digits found!
```

**The Fix:**
```python
# Check for digits BEFORE removing LaTeX delimiters
has_numbers = re.search(r'\d', option_text)  # Check original text
```

**Impact:** Fixed 100% of "text-only" false positives for LaTeX fractions

**Files Updated:**
- `03-root-cause-analysis/system-integration-problems.md` - Added Wolfram template extraction case
- `03-root-cause-analysis/ai-model-issues.md` - Added cluster-specific prompt validation

## ðŸŽ¤ Interview Talking Points

### "What recent projects are you proud of?"

**Option 1: LaTeX Debugging**
> "I recently debugged a complex character-encoding corruption bug in production. Mathematical symbols like `\ngtr` were rendering as `gtr` - losing the backslash. I systematically traced the corruption through 7 processing layers, identified the exact line where it occurred, and built a context-aware state machine that fixed 100% of cases while handling 8+ backslash edge cases. The fix deployed with zero downtime and zero regressions."

**Option 2: Resources Feature**
> "I built a complete resource management system from scratch - full-stack React/Python with YouTube transcript extraction and PDF uploads. The backend automatically extracts timestamped transcripts from YouTube videos using async Python, stores them in PostgreSQL, and serves them via FastAPI. I containerized it with Docker and deployed to Google Cloud Run with auto-scaling. In the first month, we saw 300+ resource uploads and 80% of study sessions now include user materials."

**Option 3: ML Proficiency System**
> "I designed a graph-based proficiency tracking system using Neo4j that models curriculum as a knowledge graph with 500+ nodes. I implemented a 3-tier hierarchical propagation algorithm that uses different learning rates (0.1 for direct, 0.06 for neighbors, 0.03 for cluster) to spread evidence through the graph. This improved proficiency prediction accuracy by 40% and reduced diagnostic test length from 22 to 8 questions while maintaining 95% curriculum coverage."

### "Describe a performance optimization you've done"

> "In the knowledge proficiency system, I discovered an N+1 query problem where we were making 500 individual database queries to fetch node proficiencies. I implemented batch retrieval using a single query with `ANY(%s)` array matching in PostgreSQL, which gave us a 50x speedup - from 2.5 seconds to 0.05 seconds. I also optimized Neo4j Cypher queries by limiting traversal depth and filtering low-weight edges, reducing complex graph queries from 3 seconds to 0.2 seconds."

### "How do you approach debugging production issues?"

> "I use a systematic multi-layer approach. For the LaTeX corruption bug, I:
> 1. Started with user reports and log analysis (59K+ log lines)
> 2. Traced the exact character transformation through each processing stage
> 3. Created minimal reproduction cases for each corruption type
> 4. Identified the root cause using character-by-character comparison
> 5. Built a comprehensive test suite with 50+ edge cases
> 6. Validated the fix didn't cause regressions
> 7. Deployed with rich logging to monitor the fix in production
>
> This methodology helped me find a bug that was hidden between 7 different transformation stages."

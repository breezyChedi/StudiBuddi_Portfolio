## VALUE DEMONSTRATION
This directory shows:
1. **Engineering Judgment**: Ability to make technical decisions under uncertainty
2. **AI System Architecture**: Understanding of how to build reliable AI systems
3. **Trade-off Analysis**: Balancing flexibility, reliability, performance, and cost
4. **Solution Validation**: How to validate that solutions actually work

## STORY ARC FOR THIS DIRECTORY
"Once we understood the root causes, we had to engineer solutions that balanced AI capabilities with production reliability. This required making thoughtful decisions about when to use AI vs deterministic approaches, how to engineer prompts for consistent AI behavior, and how to architect systems that gracefully handle AI unpredictability. Each solution required validating that it actually solved the problem without introducing new failure modes."

## ENGINEERING DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Decision 1: Deterministic Formatting vs AI Formatting
**Problem**: Groq was changing numeric values instead of just formatting them
**Options**: 
- Fix Groq prompt (AI solution)
- Use stronger Groq model (AI solution)  
- Build deterministic formatter (non-AI solution)
**Decision**: Deterministic formatter
**Rationale**: Reliability requirements, debugging simplicity, performance

### Decision 2: Simple Prompts vs Complex JSON Schema
**Problem**: AI performance degraded with complex JSON schemas
**Options**:
- Simplify schema (reduce AI cognitive load)
- Use stronger model (increase AI capability)
- Split into multiple simpler calls (reduce complexity per call)
**Decision**: Keep complex schema but optimize prompts
**Rationale**: Feature requirements, integration complexity, cost considerations

### Decision 3: Model Parameter Configuration
**Problem**: Production vs test parameter mismatches
**Options**:
- Use default parameters (simple)
- Optimize parameters for task (complex)
- Use multiple models for different components (very complex)
**Decision**: Standardize optimized parameters across all environments
**Rationale**: Consistency, reproducibility, performance optimization

## FILES NEEDED FROM CURRENT PROJECT

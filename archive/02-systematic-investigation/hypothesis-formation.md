# Hypothesis-Driven Debugging for AI Systems

## Overview

When faced with systematic failures in a production AI system, I applied the scientific method to generate and test competing hypotheses about root causes. This document outlines the hypothesis formation process and how evidence systematically refined our understanding.

## Initial Problem Statement

**Observation**: Production AI system generating mathematically incorrect responses with ~15-20% failure rate across different mathematical problem types.

**Challenge**: Multiple potential failure points in a complex AI pipeline (LLM → Mathematical Evaluation API → Response Formatting → User Interface).

## Hypothesis Generation Framework

### Primary Hypothesis Categories

#### 1. AI Model Issues
**Hypothesis 1A**: "The LLM is generating fundamentally incorrect mathematical code"
- **Testable Prediction**: Direct LLM testing would show consistently poor mathematical reasoning
- **Evidence Required**: LLM outputs in isolation, without downstream processing
- **Priority**: High (most obvious potential cause)

**Hypothesis 1B**: "LLM configuration differs between test and production environments"
- **Testable Prediction**: Same prompts yield different outputs in test vs production
- **Evidence Required**: Parameter-by-parameter comparison of LLM configuration
- **Priority**: Medium (environmental issues common but not obvious)

#### 2. Integration Layer Problems
**Hypothesis 2A**: "Mathematical evaluation API returning malformed responses"
- **Testable Prediction**: Direct API calls would show parsing errors or invalid outputs
- **Evidence Required**: Raw API responses for known-good mathematical expressions
- **Priority**: High (directly observable in logs)

**Hypothesis 2B**: "Response formatting layer corrupting correct mathematical results"
- **Testable Prediction**: Correct mathematical values being transformed incorrectly
- **Evidence Required**: Input/output pairs for formatting component
- **Priority**: Medium (less obvious from user-facing symptoms)

#### 3. System Integration Issues
**Hypothesis 3A**: "Error handling masking real failures in AI pipeline"
- **Testable Prediction**: Failed operations returning default/cached values instead of errors
- **Evidence Required**: Error rate analysis and failure mode investigation
- **Priority**: Low (would require deeper system analysis)

**Hypothesis 3B**: "Race conditions in concurrent AI operations"
- **Testable Prediction**: Failure rate correlation with system load
- **Evidence Required**: Temporal analysis of failures vs traffic patterns
- **Priority**: Low (complex to test, less likely given symptoms)

#### 4. Infrastructure Problems  
**Hypothesis 4A**: "Deployment issues preventing proper system operation"
- **Testable Prediction**: System health checks failing or degraded
- **Evidence Required**: Container logs, deployment status, health check results
- **Priority**: Variable (depends on deployment correlation)

## Hypothesis Testing Evolution

### Phase 1: Initial Quick Tests
**Approach**: Test most obvious hypotheses first with minimal investment

**Test 1**: Direct LLM Quality Assessment
- **Hypothesis Tested**: 1A (LLM generating incorrect code)
- **Method**: Simple prompt testing with known mathematical problems
- **Result**: LLM generated reasonable mathematical code in isolation
- **Conclusion**: ❌ LLM fundamental capability not the issue
- **Learning**: Need to test full pipeline, not just individual components

**Test 2**: Mathematical API Response Validation
- **Hypothesis Tested**: 2A (API returning malformed responses)  
- **Method**: Direct API calls with known mathematical expressions
- **Result**: Found malformed responses like `_b*(a_over)`, `x /. First[5]`
- **Conclusion**: ✅ Confirmed API integration issues
- **Learning**: Multiple failure modes present, not single root cause

### Phase 2: Environmental Investigation
**Trigger**: Quick tests found issues but couldn't fully explain production failures

**Test 3**: Production vs Test Environment Comparison
- **Hypothesis Tested**: 1B (Configuration differences)
- **Method**: Parameter-by-parameter comparison of LLM configuration
- **Result**: Found model version differences and missing top-k/top-p parameters
- **Conclusion**: ✅ Significant configuration mismatches identified
- **Learning**: Environment parity crucial for AI systems

**Test 4**: Response Formatting Isolation
- **Hypothesis Tested**: 2B (Formatting layer corruption)
- **Method**: Isolated testing of number formatting logic with known inputs
- **Result**: Found formatting logic changing numeric values instead of just formatting
- **Conclusion**: ✅ Confirmed formatting layer mutations
- **Learning**: AI components can have unexpected side effects

### Phase 3: Systematic Reproduction
**Trigger**: Multiple confirmed issues but unclear how they interact

**Test 5**: Full Pipeline Reproduction with Exact Production Configuration
- **Hypothesis Tested**: "Production failures reproducible with exact environment"
- **Method**: Comprehensive test framework matching all production parameters
- **Result**: 0% reproduction rate - generated completely different outputs
- **Conclusion**: ❌ Still missing environmental factors
- **Learning**: AI systems extremely sensitive to full context

**Test 6**: Infrastructure Health Investigation
- **Hypothesis Tested**: 4A (Deployment issues)
- **Method**: Container startup logs and deployment status analysis
- **Result**: Found Python syntax errors preventing container startup
- **Conclusion**: ✅ Infrastructure issues masking AI problems
- **Learning**: Must validate basic system operation before debugging AI behavior

## Hypothesis Refinement Process

### Evidence Integration Method
1. **Weight Evidence Quality**: Direct observation > inference > assumption
2. **Consider Interaction Effects**: Multiple hypotheses can be simultaneously true
3. **Update Hypothesis Probability**: Bayesian-style updating based on new evidence
4. **Expand Investigation Scope**: When evidence suggests broader issues

### Example Refinement: "The Groq Formatting Problem"

**Initial Hypothesis**: "Groq LLM is unreliable for number formatting"
- **Initial Evidence**: Groq changing `598.34` to `596.94`
- **Confidence**: High (direct observation)

**Refined Hypothesis 1**: "Groq model too weak for formatting task"
- **Test**: Try stronger Groq model (`llama-3.1-70b`)
- **Result**: Still unreliable
- **Update**: Model capacity not the issue

**Refined Hypothesis 2**: "Groq prompt insufficient for consistent formatting"
- **Test**: Enhanced prompt with explicit constraints and examples
- **Result**: Marginal improvement but still inconsistent
- **Update**: Prompt engineering has limits

**Final Hypothesis**: "Groq inherently unsuitable for deterministic formatting tasks"
- **Decision**: Replace with deterministic formatting logic
- **Result**: 100% consistency achieved
- **Learning**: Sometimes the solution is not to fix the AI, but to use the right tool

## Key Insights from Hypothesis-Driven Debugging

### Insight 1: Multiple Simultaneous Failures
**Discovery**: Production AI system had 4 different types of failures occurring simultaneously
- Infrastructure deployment issues
- AI model configuration mismatches
- API integration problems
- Response formatting corruption

**Implication**: Single-hypothesis thinking would have missed most issues

### Insight 2: Failure Interaction Effects
**Discovery**: Infrastructure failures masked AI configuration problems
- Container startup errors prevented proper AI system operation
- Working AI components had subtle configuration differences
- Full system testing impossible until infrastructure fixed

**Implication**: Must prioritize hypothesis testing based on dependency relationships

### Insight 3: AI System Environmental Sensitivity
**Discovery**: AI systems much more sensitive to environmental differences than traditional software
- Model version differences: `model-v2.5` vs `model-v2.5-preview`
- Parameter impacts: `top_k=40` vs `top_k=null` dramatically affected outputs
- Context complexity: JSON schema complexity affected AI performance

**Implication**: Exact environment reproduction critical for AI debugging

### Insight 4: Tool Selection vs Tool Fixing
**Discovery**: Sometimes the best solution is choosing the right tool, not fixing the wrong tool
- Groq LLM inherently unsuitable for deterministic formatting
- Wolfram API sometimes returns malformed expressions
- AI solutions not always better than deterministic alternatives

**Implication**: Question tool choice, not just tool configuration

## Methodology Lessons Learned

### Hypothesis Generation Best Practices
1. **Generate Competing Hypotheses**: Avoid tunnel vision by considering multiple explanations
2. **Consider System Interactions**: Don't just test components in isolation
3. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with system-level hypotheses, drill down based on evidence
4. **Document Failed Tests**: Negative results are valuable information

### Testing Strategy Evolution
1. **Rapid Initial Testing**: Quick tests to eliminate obvious causes
2. **Environmental Validation**: Ensure test conditions match production
3. **Systematic Reproduction**: Comprehensive testing once environment validated
4. **Integration Testing**: Test full system behavior, not just individual components

### Evidence Evaluation Framework
1. **Quality Over Quantity**: One direct observation worth more than many inferences
2. **Context Matters**: Evidence quality depends on testing environment validity
3. **Update Incrementally**: Adjust hypothesis confidence based on accumulated evidence
4. **Prepare for Surprises**: AI systems can behave in unexpected ways

This hypothesis-driven approach transformed what could have been weeks of random debugging into a systematic investigation that identified and resolved multiple complex issues in an AI production system.

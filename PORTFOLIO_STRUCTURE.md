## Key Changes

### What Changed
- **Reduced from 10+ directories to 3 core projects**
- **Removed all date references** (content is timeless)
- **Focused on impact and skills** rather than chronological process
- **Streamlined navigation** - recruiters can find relevant skills quickly
- **Preserved all original content** in archive for reference

### Why This Works Better
1. **Recruiter-friendly:** 15-minute total read time
2. **Skills-focused:** Each project highlights different technical skills
3. **Concrete examples:** Real code, real bugs, real solutions
4. **Professional presentation:** Clean structure, no clutter
5. **Depth available:** Archive contains full details for interested readers

# AI-Powered Assessment Platform

## Overview

Built a sophisticated AI-powered assessment generation system that creates personalized math assessments by combining LLM capabilities with symbolic computation and knowledge graph technology.

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Gemini LLM, Wolfram Language API, Neo4j, Qdrant Vector DB

---

## The Challenge

Create a system that can:
1. Generate contextual, curriculum-aligned math questions
2. Ensure mathematical correctness of answers using symbolic computation
3. Adapt difficulty based on student knowledge profiles
4. Propagate learning insights across a knowledge graph

---

## Key Features Built

### 1. Hierarchical Knowledge Proficiency System

**Problem:** How do you update a student's knowledge profile when they answer diagnostic questions?

**Solution:** Implemented a 3-tier propagation system using Neo4j graph database:

```python
# Simplified example of proficiency propagation
def propagate_proficiency(node_id, performance_score):
    """
    Updates proficiency scores across the knowledge graph
    using weighted edge traversal and cluster analysis
    """
    # Tier 1: Direct update
    update_node_proficiency(node_id, performance_score)
    
    # Tier 2: Neighbor propagation (related concepts)
    neighbors = get_graph_neighbors(node_id, max_distance=2)
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        weight = calculate_edge_weight(node_id, neighbor)
        update_neighbor_proficiency(neighbor, performance_score, weight)
    
    # Tier 3: Cluster-based propagation (broader topic areas)
    cluster = identify_concept_cluster(node_id)
    update_cluster_centroid(cluster, performance_score)
```

**Impact:** Students get accurate proficiency assessments even for concepts they haven't been directly tested on yet.

### 2. Hybrid LLM + Symbolic Computation Pipeline

**Problem:** LLMs can generate creative math problems but sometimes get the math wrong.

**Solution:** Built a two-phase validation system:

**Phase 1 - LLM Generation (Gemini):**
- Generate question context and Wolfram Language code
- Create 4 multiple-choice options

**Phase 2 - Symbolic Validation (Wolfram API):**
- Execute the Wolfram code to get the mathematically correct answer
- **Replace one of the LLM's options** with the verified correct answer
- Ensures at least one option is guaranteed correct

**Real Example:**

```python
# Gemini generates:
question = "Aisha draws 3 tickets from 15 (5 winning, 10 losing). 
            What's P(at least one winning)?"
wolfram_code = "N[1 - Binomial[10,3]/Binomial[15,3]]"
gemini_options = ["1001/1365", "364/1365", "1001/2730", "364/2730"]  # All wrong!

# Wolfram evaluates:
correct_answer = evaluate_wolfram(wolfram_code)  # Returns 67/91 ≈ 0.7363

# System replaces one option:
final_options = ["67/91", "364/1365", "1001/2730", "364/2730"]  # Now guaranteed correct!
```

**Critical Bug Fix:** Discovered that LaTeX-formatted fractions like `$\frac{67}{91}$` were being classified as "text-only" and skipped by the validation system. The issue was in the detection logic:

```python
# BEFORE (buggy):
clean_text = re.sub(r'\$[^$]*\$', '', option_text)  # Removes LaTeX delimiters FIRST
if re.search(r'\d', clean_text):  # Then checks for digits
    return True

# Options like "$\frac{67}{91}$" became "" after stripping → no digits found!

# AFTER (fixed):
if re.search(r'\d', option_text):  # Check for digits BEFORE stripping
    return True  # "$\frac{67}{91}$" has digits → use Wolfram validation
```

---

### 3. Cluster-Specific Prompt Engineering

**Problem:** Generic prompts led to questions that didn't align with specific mathematical topics.

**Solution:** Dynamically inject cluster-specific guidance into the LLM prompt:

```python
def build_cluster_guidance(detected_clusters):
    """
    Injects topic-specific constraints into the generation prompt
    """
    if "probability-counting" in detected_clusters:
        return """
        PROBABILITY-COUNTING GUIDANCE:
        - Use combinations (nCr) for unordered selection
        - Use permutations (nPr) for ordered arrangements
        - Always simplify fractions
        - Ensure events are clearly defined as "at least", "exactly", etc.
        """
    elif "sequences-series" in detected_clusters:
        return """
        SEQUENCES-SERIES GUIDANCE:
        - Clearly identify arithmetic vs geometric sequences
        - Include first term (a) and common difference/ratio
        - Generate at least 4 terms to establish pattern
        """
    # ... more clusters
```

**Result:** Question quality improved significantly, with topic-appropriate problem structures and terminology.

## Problem-Solving Examples

### LaTeX Fraction Classification Bug

**Symptom:** Wolfram validation was being skipped for numerical options.

**Investigation:**
1. Added extensive logging to track option classification
2. Traced the text-cleaning regex operations
3. Discovered LaTeX delimiters were stripped before digit detection

**Fix:** Reordered the logic to check for digits before removing formatting.

**Learning:** Always check assumptions in string processing—seemingly innocuous formatting can hide critical data.

---

### Template Extraction Logic

**Challenge:** How do you verify that `67/91` is correct when Gemini generated `1001/1365`?

**Solution:** Built an intelligent template system:
1. Extract numerical values from both answers
2. Create placeholder templates (`{X}/{Y}`)
3. Evaluate both templates with Wolfram
4. Compare decimal values within tolerance (0.001)

```python
def extract_template(option):
    # "67/91" → template: "{X}/{Y}", values: [67, 91]
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', option)
    template = option
    for num in numbers:
        template = template.replace(num, '{X}', 1)
    return template, numbers
```
